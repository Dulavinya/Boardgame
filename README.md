# 🎲 OOP Board Game Simulation

This project is a console-based simulation of a simple board game, implemented using Object-Oriented Programming in Python. The game features a linked list of tiles and players who move forward based on dice rolls.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `Tile`: Represents a single tile in the game board (linked list node).
- `Player`: Each player can move forward along the tiles.
- `Die`: Simulates a dice roll with configurable sides.
- `Board`: Manages tiles and player positions.
- `main()`: Demonstrates sample gameplay logic.
